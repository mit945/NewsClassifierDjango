`python manage.py makemigrations classifier`
-- Telling django that I am making changes in models

`python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001`
-- Return SQL commands that initialize the schema

`python manage.py migrate`
-- to create those model tables in your database:

Explanation on Views:
- In our classifier  application, we’ll have the following four views:

Classifier “index” page – displays the latest few questions.
Classifier “detail” page – allow to enter news text
Classifier “results” page – displays results for a particular question.
Categorize  action – handles category prediction for a news

In Django, web pages and other content are delivered by views. Each view is represented by a Python function (or method, in the case of class-based views). Django will choose a view by examining the URL that’s requested (to be precise, the part of the URL after the domain name).
